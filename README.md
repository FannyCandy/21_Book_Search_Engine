# Book Search Engine

## Description
This project is to refactor the given code that built with a RESTful API, to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
Tasks as follow:
- Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
- Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
- Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
